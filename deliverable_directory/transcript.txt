 Hi, my name is Logan, and I am currently playing something that has a lot of background noise, as you can hear in the original video. Hopefully, the new video cleans it up. And just to double check, I'm going to sing a song for you in hopes that you are able to hear what I'm saying rather than the background. We're no strangers to love. You know the rules, and so do I.  A full commitment's what I'm thinking of. You wouldn't get this from any other guy. I just want to tell you how I'm feeling. I want to make you understand. Never going to give you up. Never going to let you down. Never going to run around and desert you. Never going to make you cry. Never going to say goodbye. Never going to tell a lie and hurt you. Thank you.
